# 🧠 Google Job Searcher – Chrome Extension

A simple Chrome extension that collects **Google Search results** for job queries and exports them to a **CSV file**.  
It can now **automatically run preselected searches** (like “frontend developer jobs”) and gather results for later export.

## 🚀 Features

- Scrapes job-related search results directly from Google SERP pages
- Filters results by relevant keywords (e.g. developer, engineer, software)
- Exports all results to a **CSV file** with title, link, and snippet
- NEW: Automatically runs **preselected searches** for hands-free updates
- Stores all results locally using `chrome.storage.local`

## 🧩 How It Works

1. Click the extension icon in Chrome.
2. Press **“Search”** → runs multiple Google searches automatically.
3. After a few seconds, press **“Export CSV”** → downloads your filtered job listings.
